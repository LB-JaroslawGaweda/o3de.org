The Recast Navigation Gem provides support for building navigation meshes and calculating walkable paths within those navigation meshes. It uses open source library [Recast Navigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation).

An example of its use can be found in AutomatedTesting project in Navigation Sample level.

This Gem includes the following features:
* Select an area to build a navigation mesh from PhysX colliders
* Create a navigation mesh
* Configure navigation mesh parameters
* Find paths between entities or positions within a navigation mesh
* Visualize the navigation mesh
