We’re excited to announce the latest release of the [Open 3D Engine (O3DE)](/), as the community gathers in Austin, Texas for [O3DCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/o3dcon/). Release 22.10 brings a wealth of performance, stability and usability enhancements, making it easier for developers, artists and content creators worldwide to build amazing 3D experiences. New capabilities ease team onboarding and collaboration, artist workflows and multiplayer setup, alongside additional rendering features and increased Terrain system performance, which is now available in preview.

Check out the highlights of this latest release, and get the details in the full release [notes](/docs/release-notes/22-10-0/).

##### **Easier Onboarding and Collaboration**
With a host of new features, you can onboard and collaborate with team members more easily. Remote projects allow teams to share and download projects by sharing just a URL, while project templates make it easier to create multiple, similar projects with the ability to use or create a starting setup. Teams can get into projects and levels more quickly with the ability to share processed assets more easily using networked asset cache. And you can create new gems more quickly and easily with a gem creation wizard.

##### **Multiplayer Application Enhancements**
It’s now easier to set up multiplayer applications with features like client-server connection, debugging and network spawning.

##### **Artist Workflow Improvements**
Bringing animations into O3DE just became easier. Root motion extraction is now supported natively in O3DE, and a host of enhancements have been made to the animation import process, including improvements to the asset browser and hot reloading of assets.

##### **New Viewport Interaction Features**
It’s now easier and smoother to work with entities and prefabs in the world using new features that improve viewport interaction, specifically viewport entity selection and prefab edit mode.

##### **Increased Terrain Performance**
With this latest release, the Terrain system has moved from an experimental state into preview. Developers who are using O3DE in smaller or more enclosed environments to work on larger-scale worlds will see a significant improvement in performance, both for editing and runtime/rendering. The O3DE Terrain system can now scale to 16km x 16km worlds and beyond at high frame rates, or 256x performance.

##### **New Rendering Features**
You can more easily generate [sky atmosphere](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/9649) and [stars](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/8624) using built-in additions.
For all you developers, artists and content creators around the globe, we’re looking forward to seeing the incredible experiences you bring to life using these new features. Share them with our [community](http://Discord.com/invite/o3de)—we’d love to showcase your creations on the [O3DE website](/).

We want to thank our community for their collaboration in accelerating the Open 3D Engine’s maturity on the path to becoming the go-to choice for creators who want a modular approach to building immersive 3D experiences. It’s gratifying to see the results of their hard work, and we can’t wait to see what they accomplish next!
